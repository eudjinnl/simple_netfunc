"""
Build list of all devices using cdp crawling.
Send commands from  _cisco_commands.txt file to devices defined in PATTERNS.
By default save running-config to memory.
    Config saving can be overridden by adding variable write_memory=False to nmk_send_conf_command function
Backup config as hostname-YYYY-MM-DD text file to the path defined in file _backup_path.txt. 
If there is no the file or it is empty config files will be written in working directory.
